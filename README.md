🔐 CLOAKID

Secure & Controlled PII/SPII Data Sharing Platform

CLOAKID is a secure web-based data-sharing platform designed for sharing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII) between verified users.

Unlike traditional file-sharing systems, CLOAKID focuses on giving the sender continuous control over shared data, even after it has been sent. Senders can define who can access their data, how long it remains accessible, how many times it can be viewed, whether it can be reshared, and when access should be revoked.

The system is designed around security, privacy, controlled disclosure, traceability, and temporary data storage.

🎯 Project Purpose

CLOAKID aims to provide a safer way to share sensitive information without relying on unrestricted public links or permanent file storage.

The platform is intended for information such as:

- Government/identity documents
- ID numbers
- Contact information
- Sensitive documents
- Medical records
- Criminal records
- Domicile information
- Other PII and SPII

The system ensures that sensitive information is shared only with verified users and remains accessible according to rules defined by the sender.

✨ Key Features

1. 👤 Verified User Sharing

CLOAKID uses a verification-based sharing model.

Both sender and receiver must have verified accounts before sensitive information can be exchanged.

Includes

- User registration
- Email verification
- Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Verified receiver checking
- Prevention of sharing with unverified users

When a sender enters a receiver's email address, CLOAKID verifies whether that user exists and has a verified account before allowing the sharing process to continue.

---

2. 📤 Controlled Data Sharing

The sender can initiate a secure sharing session and choose how information will be provided.

Sharing modes

- Image Mode
- Form/Template Mode

The sender can upload or capture an image or create information using a predefined/custom form.

---

3. 🕵️ Sensitive Data Redaction

Before sharing information, the sender can hide sensitive portions of the data.

Supported redaction concepts include:

- Blur
- Pixelation
- Hiding selected areas
- Selective disclosure

This allows the sender to expose only the information required by the receiver.

---

4. 🔍 Progressive Disclosure

One of CLOAKID's main features is Progressive Disclosure.

Instead of exposing an entire document immediately, the receiver initially sees only the permitted information.

If additional information is required, the receiver can request access to more content.

The sender then decides whether the additional information should be revealed.

Example

A user needs to verify an identity document but does not need to see the complete document.

CLOAKID can initially hide certain fields.

The receiver can request access to a hidden section, while the sender retains the ability to approve or reject the request.

---

5. 👑 Sender Control After Sharing

CLOAKID is designed around the principle that sharing data should not mean losing control over it.

After sending information, the sender can:

- View active sharing sessions
- Modify permissions
- Change expiry time
- Change view limits
- Modify sharing permissions
- Revoke access
- Re-grant access
- Monitor receiver activity
- Respond to access requests
- Delete a sharing session

---

6. ⏱️ Time-Based Access Control

The sender can define how long the receiver can access shared information.

Once the permitted access period expires, the system restricts access.

The SRS specifies a deletion window after expiration during which access can potentially be restored or modified before permanent deletion.

---

7. 👁️ View Limits

The sender can control how many times the receiver can view shared information.

For every access:

- The system tracks the view
- The remaining view count is updated
- The sender receives an activity notification
- Access is blocked when the permitted limit is reached

---

8. 🚫 Revoke Access

The sender can immediately stop access to previously shared information.

When access is revoked:

1. The sender selects Revoke Access
2. The active permission is invalidated
3. The receiver can no longer access the shared data

This provides the sender with control even after the data has already been shared.

---

9. 🔄 Re-Grant Access

Previously revoked access can be restored by the sender.

The sender can reactivate permissions and potentially increase:

- Access duration
- Number of permitted views

---

10. 🔗 Controlled Resharing

By default, resharing is disabled.

If the sender allows resharing, it can be restricted according to the sharing rules defined by the system.

Resharing activity is also recorded so that the sender can maintain visibility over where the information has been shared.

---

11. 💧 Watermarking

Shared information receives a watermark for security and traceability.

The watermark can be:

- Customized by the sender
- Generated using the purpose of sharing
- Applied with the default phrase defined by the system

The SRS specifies the default watermark concept as:

«"NOT VALID FOR OTHER PURPOSES"»

Watermarks are intended to discourage misuse and provide visible context about the purpose of shared information.

---

12. 📋 Activity Monitoring & Audit Logs

CLOAKID records activities associated with shared data.

The sender can monitor:

- Who accessed the information
- When it was accessed
- Number of views
- Access requests
- Resharing activity, where permitted
- Other relevant sharing events

These activities are stored as audit information to provide traceability and accountability.

---

13. 🔔 Notifications

The system provides notifications for important sharing events.

Examples include:

- New data shared with a receiver
- Receiver viewed the data
- Receiver requested additional access
- Receiver requested hidden information
- Data was reshared where permitted
- Access requests were approved or rejected

Notifications are intended to keep the sender aware of activity involving their shared information.

---

14. 🔐 Encryption & Secure Transmission

CLOAKID is designed to encrypt sensitive information before temporary storage and transmission.

The SRS specifies:

- Encryption of sensitive data
- Secure HTTPS/TLS communication
- Temporary encrypted storage
- Decryption when authorized data is viewed

Data is intended to remain encrypted until a valid access request is processed.

---

15. 🗑️ Temporary Data Storage & Automatic Deletion

CLOAKID is not intended to be a permanent file-storage platform.

Shared information remains available only for the defined sharing/deletion period.

After the deletion deadline:

- The shared session is removed
- Stored data is permanently deleted
- The original/shared temporary copy is removed according to the system's deletion process

The SRS specifies a two-hour post-expiration deletion window.

---

👥 User Roles

Sender

The sender is the primary controller of shared information.

The sender can:

- Register and verify an account
- Select a receiver
- Upload/create information

- Configure access controls
- Share information
- Monitor activity
- Modify permissions

⚠️ Important Security Note

CLOAKID is designed as a security-focused academic project. Security claims made by the project should be validated through implementation testing, code review, penetration testing, and appropriate security assessment before the system is used for real sensitive information.

The current SRS defines the intended functionality and security requirements; it does not by itself guarantee that an implementation will be secure.
